      <description>I have recently watched this great TED talk by Michael Brody-Waite. Michael is talking about 3 principles: be authentic, surrender the outcomes and do uncomfortable work. These principles resonated with me and made me think about myself and How I am doing against them. In his talk, he also tells us about how he has been using the quite famous &amp;ldquo;What is your greatest weakness ?&amp;quot; interview question to get people to be authentic and talk about themselves.</description>

      <description>This post was inspired by Colin Walter&amp;rsquo;s blog post on why he works on OpenShift and Fedora/RHEL go and check it out ðŸ˜„.
Understanding our &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo; is usually a process that a team will go through. Why, as a team, are we together? What problems are we solving? How are we solvings these problems? There is value in asking ourselves why we show up to work every weekday and what motivates us.</description>
