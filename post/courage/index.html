      <p>I have recently watched this great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUnRKf2CemA">TED talk</a> by Michael Brody-Waite. Michael is talking about 3 principles: be authentic, surrender the outcomes and do uncomfortable work. These principles resonated with me and made me think about myself and How I am doing against them. In his talk, he also tells us about how he has been using the quite famous <em>&ldquo;What is your greatest weakness ?&quot;</em> interview question to get people to be authentic and talk about themselves. What follows is me answering this question.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of years, I started to realize that my greatest weakness was a lack of courage. Not the courage that relates to bravery but the courage of being vulnerable, being uncomfortable with others. I learned that I value a lot of connections with others, taking actions that put these connections at risks scares me.</p>
<p>Often that lack of courage is materialized by fear and insecurity. Questions like, <em>&ldquo;Am I good enough? &ldquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;What do others think about me? &ldquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;Should I say that? &ldquo;</em>, start to become inhibitors and restrain my capacity to take actions. As an example I have been living in Poland for the last 4 years, and my Polish language skills are far from being great. The main reason for me not having made better progress is that speaking in polish makes me uncomfortable. I am feeling vulnerable, judged, and I start doubting myself. <em>&ldquo;Will I be understood? &ldquo;</em> <em>&ldquo;Will I understand others? &ldquo;</em>&rdquo; This is hard and it feels much better to stay in my comfort zone.</p>
<p>Recently, I learned that the word courage comes from the Latin <em>cor</em> which means <em>heart</em>, its original definition is <em>&ldquo;to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart&rdquo;</em>. I find that definition excellent, it emphasizes the fact that being yourself and true about yourself is hard. Looking forward, I want to push myself to be more vulnerable and speak more about my weaknesses and fears. I believe this can have a strong impact in today&rsquo;s world. Let&rsquo;s be more authentic instead of pretending to have a perfect life, showing off on social media, and using filters to hide our weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.&rdquo; - Bruce Lee</strong>.</p>
