# Don't focus on productivity, it is not Valuable

Over the last few weeks, I have been encouraging my team during 1:1s to write more blog posts. Being able to write and explain the awesome work we do as a team is really valuable, but like any skills writing well requires regular practice.

These conversations led to the following feedback, engineers may feel that writing blog posts has a less value than writing code. That feeling leads to the assumption that taking a couple days to write a blog post during a week is going to be seen as a productivity drop from the individual.
This is a feeling I would like to down play.
